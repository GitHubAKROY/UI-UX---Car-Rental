Describtion:

Project: Restaurant App & Community

A Figma prototype for a restaurant discovery & community platform. The design focuses on helping users find restaurants, share experiences, and engage with a community of food lovers. The app brings together restaurant listings, reviews, social interactions, and user-generated content in a seamless UX/UI.

Key Features / Components

Restaurant Discovery / Listings
Browse restaurants by category, cuisine type, rating, location, or recommendations. Each listing includes details such as images, price range, opening hours, menus, etc.

Search & Filters
Powerful search functionality with filters (e.g. cuisine, price, distance, ratings) to help users quickly narrow down options to restaurants that match their preference.

Detailed Restaurant View
When a restaurant is selected: full page with photos, address/map, contact info, menu, hours, reviews, possibly similar restaurants suggestions.

Community & Social Interactions
Users can write reviews, post photos, rate restaurants, follow other food-lovers, like/bookmark restaurants, share experiences.

User Profile & Contributions
Profiles for users: see their reviews, contributions, saved favourites/restaurants, possibly their ranking or badges within the community.

Interactive Features
Options like leaving reviews or comments, uploading food photos, sharing restaurant info with friends or via social media, maybe “check-in” or recommendations from other users.

Favorites / Saved
Ability to bookmark or save restaurants you want to try or revisit, with a personal “favorites” or “wishlist” view.

Map / Location Integration
Map view to see nearby restaurants, navigate to them, or view spatial distribution of restaurants around your current location.

Settings / Notifications
User settings (profile, alert preferences, notification settings), maybe theme preferences, etc.

Visual / UI & UX Style

Clean and attractive restaurant imagery (high-quality photos), visually appealing layout that showcases food and ambience.

Strong hierarchy: restaurant names & ratings prominent, menus and reviews given good readability.

Balanced use of icons, colour accents (for categories, ratings etc.), consistent styling of buttons, cards, navigation.

Smooth navigation and transitions between discovery, detail, community components.

Goals & Purpose

To build a restaurant app that does more than just listing—integrate community and social proof so users can make informed, inspired decisions.

To enhance user trust (through reviews, photos, community feedback) and satisfaction by offering rich restaurant info and interactive features.

To demonstrate UI/UX skills in designing a consumer-app with multiple flows: discovery, social interaction, personal profile, etc.
